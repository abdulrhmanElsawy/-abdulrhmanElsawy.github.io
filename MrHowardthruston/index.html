                <h1>Joel Carson</h1>

                <h2>Salt Lake City's #1 Agent</h2>

                <p>My service in the U.S. Navy prepared me to fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming one of Utah's top Realtors. Through service to my country I learned focus, discipline, respect and a profound work ethic. Today, I am an award-winning real
                    estate professional ranked No. 1 in Utah by RealTrends Inc. and Newsweek Magazine.</p>

                <p>I have lived in the Salt Lake Valley my entire life. As a real estate professional with more than 30 years experience, my expertise is unmatched in Utah. I use my knowledge and experience to provide second-to-none service for my clients.
                    I am regularly nominated for local awards and in 2020, I was voted the Top Utah Real Estate Agent in Salt Lake City by residents of the Salt Lake Valley.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Selling your home can be overwhelming so I take a strategic approach. My company is a well-oiled machine meticulously planned to work for you from our first meeting to closing. My strategy will make the entire process smooth and will have
                    a low impact on you and your family. I am Covid-trained and conscious. I adhere to CDC recommended guidelines to keep you safe during the selling process.</p>
                <h4>Highest Standards</h4>

                <p class="highest-standards">
                    You will work with me directly throughout the process. I will not pawn you off to another agent like a lot of large teams do. I pride myself on being available every step of the way. I do this by having a full-time professional staff that supports me
                    behind the scenes. I approach home sales with a full service approach. I insist on a flawless presentation so I work with some of the best professionals in the business and pay for them to make sure you're happy with the final result.
